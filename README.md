In eurem Code bitte darauf achten. Wir wollen es ja von Beginn an richtig machen :)

    -Python is case-sensitive, which means, for example, Name and name have different meanings
    -The standard is to use English names in programming
    -All variables should start with a lowercase letter, for example,  var = 4
    -Functions begin with lowercase
    -Classes begins with a capital letter
    
    des weiteren:
    -The first letter of a variable, function, or class must be one of the letters (a-z) or (A-Z). Numbers or special characters such as & and% are not allowed
    -Special characters cannot be used in names
    -There are reserved words, such as and, if, else, break, import, and more, which are not allowed in naming. All reserved words can be found here
    -Python is sensitive to indentations, that marks a block segment in your code



The Zen of Python:

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
